ShopSpectra, a fictitious online retail company, wants to determine if targeted advertisements increase conversion rate as compared to showing their current public service announcements (PSAs) or nothing at all. They are hopeful to see a 2% change in conversion from 1% to 3%. To do this, they run an A/B test to measure the impact of showing Ads or PSAs on the conversion rate. Essentially, conversion or no conversion means whether people end up buying a product or not.

Purpose: The aim is to find if showing the targeted ads created any impact. In other words, was the campaign successful? And if successful, what is the measured impact?
