    "\n",
    "Scenario: ShopSpectra, an online retail company, wants to determine if targeted advertisements increase conversion rate as compared to showing their current public service announcements (PSAs) or nothing at all. They are hopeful to see a **2%** change in conversion from **1%** to **3%**. To do this, they run an A/B test to measure the impact of showing Ads or PSAs on the conversion rate. Essentially, conversion or no conversion means whether people end up buying a product or not. \n",

    "Purpose: The aim is to find if showing the targeted ads created any impact. In other words, was the campaign successful? And if successful, what is the measured impact?\n",

It requires one additional step where we calculate proportional sample size before we get proportion effect size. To understand this, first let's understand types of effect size.\n",

It used for scenarios where we test whether the avg value between two group is different or not. Example: average order value differs between two groups, average session time between users shown two different page layouts. In this scenario, Relative Effect Size is (3 - 1)/2 *100 = 100%\n",
    "    \n",
    "Absolute Effect Size means the direct difference in metric i.e. New value - Old Value. It is used when the primary metric has binary outcome. Example: whether the conversion rate (e.g., the percentage of users making a purchase) differs between two groups, click-through rate (CTR) between users who see different ads. In this scenario, Absolute Difference is 3% - 1% = 2%. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Additional Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before feeding effect size to the main function that calculates sample size, we do an additional step of calculating proportional effect size. We use **proportion_samplesize()** from **statsmodels module** to get proportional effect size **before calculating Sample Size**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When **relative effect size** is given, then we need to calculate the absolute measure from it i.e. get the old and new metric values so that you can use those in the **proportion_samplesize()** function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When **absolute effect size** is given, then we can use those values directly in the **proportion_samplesize()** function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**But why this additional step?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Absolute difference alone doesn’t account for the variability and distribution of the data. For example, going from 10% to 15% (5 percentage points difference) has a different impact than going from 50% to 55%, even though the absolute difference is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- proportion_effectsize() standardizes the difference between proportions, making the sample size calculation more accurate by considering the variability at different baseline rates.\n",

    "- This ensures that your A/B test has enough power to detect a statistically significant effect.\n",

    "    1. Choose the appropriate test based on \n",
    "    (i) # of Samples  (ii) Type of Metric Variable (iii) Direction of comparison (iv) Statistical test\\\n",
