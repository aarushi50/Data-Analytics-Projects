This project presents a risk-focused analysis of enterprise vulnerabilities using publicly available CVE data. The goal is to simulate how vulnerability management teams analyze exposure, track remediation performance, and communicate risk to senior leadership through dashboards and executive reports.

The analysis focuses on severity-based risk concentration, SLA compliance, vulnerability aging, trends over time, and recurring weakness patterns (CWE). The outputs are designed to mirror real-world vulnerability operations reporting used in financial institutions and large enterprises.

### Key Findings

1. The majority of vulnerabilities are successfully detected, indicating strong visibility.

2. Risk is concentrated in Critical and High severity vulnerabilities, which represent a smaller portion of total findings but drive most of the exposure.

3. SLA breaches are highest for High and Critical vulnerabilities, highlighting remediation capacity and prioritization challenges.

4. Medium and Low vulnerabilities dominate volume but have lower individual impact.

5. A small set of recurring vulnerability categories (Top 10 CWE) accounts for a significant share of total findings, indicating opportunities for preventive controls.

### Dataset

Source: Kaggle – CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewkronser/cve-common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures/data

The dataset is derived from publicly available CVE and NVD records and includes:
- CVE identifiers
- Publication dates
- CVSS scores and severity indicators
- CWE classifications
- Descriptive metadata about each vulnerability

While this is not live enterprise data, it closely resembles the structure and content of vulnerability data extracted from tools such as Qualys, Tenable, or Rapid7 after normalization.

### Notes and Assumptions

- SLA timelines and risk weighting are modeled assumptions to simulate enterprise vulnerability management practices.
- Risk scores are used as relative indicators, not absolute measures of business impact.
- Risk acceptance, false positives, and compensating controls are not explicitly modeled.
- The analysis is intended to demonstrate methodology and decision support, not replace production vulnerability tooling.

### Tools Used

- Google Sheets (data analysis, KPIs, dashboarding)
- Public CVE / NVD data
- Structured data modeling and visualization techniques

### Intended Audience

- Vulnerability Management Analysts
- Security Operations teams
- Technology Risk and Governance stakeholders
- Hiring managers evaluating security analytics capability
