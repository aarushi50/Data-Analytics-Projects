### About This Github Repository

This repository showcases a collection of data analytics and security analytics projects that reflect both my established analytics background and my ongoing transition into cybersecurity. The projects demonstrate practical experience in data preparation, exploratory analysis, KPI design, dashboarding, trend analysis, and executive-level reporting.

Included work spans vulnerability risk analysis, reporting, fraud analytics, and business intelligence, using tools such as Google Sheets, Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.
